## ABOUT

<!-- The International Conference on Computing, Statistics and Mathematics (iCMS) is a biennial conference commencing since 2013. The conference is hosted by the Faculty of Computer and Mathematical Sciences, Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Kedah, Malaysia. The focus of iCMS is on computing, mathematics and statistics discipline and the application centering on these fields of study. -->

<!-- Over the years, iCMS international conference has attracted many high quality papers from local as well as global contributors in various subjects pertaining to the three areas. Not to mention, our biggest success in terms of publication where all papers in iCMS2017 are published in indexed journals and proceeding. In the previous conference iCMS2019, more than 100 papers have been accepted. To date, nearly half of the papers presented at the conference have been published in selected Scopus indexed journals while the remaining papers are in final steps to be published in other various suitable indexed journals. -->

<!-- The organising committee had also successfully hosted pre-conference workshop namely, “Visualization of Tidy Data” that was conducted by international reputable expert, Dr. Matthias Templ from Statistics Austria and Vienna University of technology and received positive feedback from the participants. -->

<!-- iCMS2021 will be our fifth international conference. The theme of this coming conference is “Driving Research Toward Excellence”. Given the rapidity with which computing, mathematics, and statistics are advancing in all areas of life, we strongly believed that this upcoming conference is the best platform available for researchers to come together presenting their practical solutions for a better tomorrow as well as become a catalyst for stimulating ideas to further enhance future research and innovations.\ -->

The International Conference on Computing, Statistics, and Mathematics (iCMS) has been a biennial gathering since its inception in 2013, and we are thrilled to announce the upcoming iCMS 2024, marking our fifth conference after the successful iCMS 2021. Organized by the Faculty of Computer and Mathematical Sciences at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Kedah, Malaysia, iCMS continues to be a key forum focusing on the disciplines of computing, mathematics, and statistics, exploring their applications and advancements.\

Throughout the years, iCMS has consistently attracted high-quality papers from both local and global contributors, covering a diverse range of subjects within these three domains. Notably, iCMS 2017 achieved significant success with all presented papers published in indexed journals and proceedings. In the subsequent iCMS 2019, over 100 papers were accepted, with a substantial portion published in Scopus indexed journals, and the rest in various other suitable indexed journals.\

The organizing committee has also successfully hosted pre-conference workshops, such as the "Visualization of Tidy Data," conducted by the internationally renowned expert, Dr. Matthias Templ from Statistics Austria and Vienna University of Technology, garnering positive feedback from participants.\

In our previous conference, iCMS 2021, we celebrated a significant milestone and expanded our offerings with the successful inclusion of two pre-conference workshops. Pre-Conference Workshop 1, titled "Predictive Analytics using IBM SPSS Modeller 18" was conducted by Prof. Dr. Yap Bee Wah from the Institute for Big Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Shah Alam. Prof. Dr. Yap shared valuable insights into predictive analytics, leveraging the capabilities of IBM SPSS Modeler 18.\

Additionally, Pre-Conference Workshop 2, titled "R Markdown in Academic Writing" was led by Mr. Kamarul Ariffin Mansor from Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Kedah. Mr. Kamarul Ariffin Mansor guided participants through the effective use of R Markdown in academic writing, offering practical tips for enhancing the presentation and communication of research findings.\

As we gear up for iCMS 2024, our fifth international conference, we are excited to reveal the theme for this edition, "Accelerating Innovation: Navigating the Road to Research Excellence". Building on the momentum of the previous conference's theme, "Driving Research Toward Excellence," we aim to further explore the rapid advancements in computing, mathematics, and statistics across various facets of life. We firmly believe that iCMS 2024 will provide an unparalleled platform for researchers to showcase their practical solutions, fostering collaboration, and acting as a catalyst for stimulating innovative ideas that will shape the future of research and advancements. Join us in this journey towards excellence at iCMS 2024!\
